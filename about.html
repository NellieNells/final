                My name is Nakya. Though I go by Nellie or Nells as a short nickname.
                 I am a self taught artist and designer who is persuing
                their graphic Design degree. I have been drawing for 10+ years and editing graphics for a little over 3 years.
                I grew a passion for designing and creating my own artwork when I came across my
                dad's old sketchbook when he was a teenager. I liked how it came out and it inspired me to
                try drawing in that asepect. As a designer, I came across this new passion when I was in my
                picsArt days and it's just transpired to me using advanced programs like Adobe Photoshop and such.
                My passion for designing and drawing has had it's moment of plummet,
                like most artist and designers. However that has not stopped my love
                for designing and drawing. It has in fact made it sprout little byt little in that
                aspect.
